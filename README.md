# MNIST Neural Network Classifier

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Feedforward Neural Network** (FNN) trained on an image classification dataset using backpropagation. The model is trained using different hyperparameter configurations, optimization techniques, and weight initialization strategies. The objective is to determine the best-performing model configuration and generalize the findings to the MNIST dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of grayscale images of digits (0-9). The images are **28x28 pixels**, and the goal is to classify each image into one of 10 classes.

## Implementation Details
- **Feedforward Neural Network**: Fully connected layers with customizable architecture.
- **Backpropagation Algorithm**: Implemented with multiple optimizers:
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
  - Momentum-based Gradient Descent
  - Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent
  - RMSprop
  - Adam
- **Activation Functions**: Sigmoid, ReLU
- **Weight Initialization**: Random, Xavier
- **Loss Functions**: Cross-Entropy vs. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - Number of hidden layers: **[3, 4, 5]**
  - Neurons per layer: **[32, 64, 128]**
  - Learning rate: **[1e-3, 1e-4]**
  - Batch sizes: **[16, 32, 64]**
  - Optimizers: **SGD, Momentum, Nesterov, RMSprop, Adam**

## Results and Analysis
After extensive experimentation, the following configurations performed the best on the validation set:

### **Best 3 Configurations for MNIST**
| Configuration | Optimizer | Learning Rate | Hidden Layers | Neurons per Layer | Activation | Accuracy |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|------------|----------|
| Config 1     | Adam      | 1e-3          | 3             | 64-64-64          | ReLU       | **98.2%** |
| Config 2     | SGD+Momentum | 1e-3       | 4             | 128-128-64-64     | ReLU       | **97.8%** |
| Config 3     | RMSprop   | 1e-4          | 5             | 64-64-64-32-32    | Sigmoid    | **97.5%** |

## Key Insights
1. **Adam with ReLU and 3 hidden layers performed the best**, balancing speed and accuracy.
2. **SGD with momentum also performed well** but required more epochs for convergence.
3. **RMSprop with lower learning rates worked well with deeper networks**, but deeper networks didn't always yield better results.

## Recommendations for MNIST
Based on our experiments, we recommend the following configurations for MNIST:

1. **Adam optimizer, learning rate = 1e-3, 3 hidden layers (64-64-64), ReLU activation** → Best balance of accuracy and training speed.
2. **SGD with momentum, learning rate = 1e-3, 4 hidden layers (128-128-64-64), ReLU activation** → Good alternative if training longer.
3. **RMSprop, learning rate = 1e-4, 5 hidden layers (64-64-64-32-32), Sigmoid activation** → Works better with lower learning rates and deep networks.

## Conclusion
Our findings suggest that **Adam is the best optimizer** for MNIST with a simple **3-layer ReLU-based network**. Adding more layers did not necessarily improve performance. The **SGD + Momentum optimizer** also performed well but required careful tuning of the learning rate. **RMSprop worked well with deeper networks**, but deeper architectures did not always outperform shallower ones. 

This knowledge can be applied to similar digit recognition tasks, making these three configurations a reliable choice for the MNIST dataset.
